# SPKB

_SolidPython-based Keyboard Builder_

[![API Documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spkb/badge/?version=latest)][API docs]

![Action Shot](images/action-shot.jpg)

A [SolidPython][]-based library for building custom keyboards with [Python][] and [OpenSCAD][].

Some portions ported from Clojure, originally from [the Dactyl Keyboard][] and my fork thereof,
[the Dactyl Lynx Keyboard][].

[Python]: https://www.python.org/
[OpenSCAD]: https://openscad.org/

## Using SPKB

### Installing

Simply install the library in your project, using your preferred package manager.

[Poetry][]:
```bash
poetry add spkb
```

[PDM](https://pdm-project.org/):
```bash
pdm add
```

[pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/):
```bash
pipenv install spkb
```

[Poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/


### Usage

In your project, you can simply import what you need from the submodules of `spkb`:
```python
from spkb.switch_plate import plate_thickness, mx_plate
from spkb.board_mount import stm32_blackpill
from spkb.keycaps import sa_double_length, sa_cap
```

See the sidebar of [the documentation][API docs] for a reference of what's available.

## Developing SPKB

### Prerequisites

* [Python][] version 3.11 or newer
* [Poetry][]

### Installing dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```


### Usage

For simply generating interesting key testers, see the example scripts in the `examples/`
directory.


### Running tests

You can run simple tests from some of the submodules:
```bash
poetry run python -m spkb.keycaps         # Renders the built-in keycap approximations
poetry run python -m spkb.single_key_pcb  # Renders a simple approximation of a single-key PCB
poetry run python -m spkb.single_tester   # Renders a single-key tester
poetry run python -m spkb.keyswitch.choc  # Renders a switch socket with backplate for a Kailh Choc switch
poetry run python -m spkb.keyswitch.mx    # Renders a switch socket with backplate for an MX-style switch

# Deprecated modules
poetry run python -m spkb.switch_plate    # Renders a variety of keyswitch plates (sockets)
poetry run python -m spkb.keyswitch       # Renders a basic approximation of an MX-style switch body
```

You can also run all module tests and check for appropriate outputs with this script:
```bash
scripts/run-module-tests.sh
```
